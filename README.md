>### GUMP
I have included gump for validation. Just check gump on github to know how to use it for for all validations.

>### Notifyjs
I have included the notifyjs plugin for all our notifications.

>### Database

Create a database named 'career' and import the database in the database folder

>### extra info

Once a company signs up, they are sent a link to their email so that they can activate their account. I will implemented that because i have done it before. But for clarity, just know that to sign up, all you have to enter is the email and password and then once you activate your account, you will then have to fill your profile.

>### Task
You guys have to work on the company part for now.
  
>### Always create a new branch
Once you complete solving an issue or task, checkout and create a new branch and push to that branch. Never push to the master branch.

>### CSS and JS
There is a custom.css and a custom.js files included in the css and js folders respectively. Dont edit the bootstrap css and js files. Never touch them. Incase we ever want to updagrade to a later version of bootstrap, we won't have issues

>### why using get.php and post.php
For all post methods or queries that involve inserting, creating, updating and deleting something on the database, direct all the URL's to the post.php and then reroute them to the correct controller and method. For all get methods or queries that involve retrieving something from the database, direct all the URL's to the get.php and then reroute them to the correct view and method. I know that all this is not neccessary if we were only interacting with the controllers and never with the views. But if we are to use the first MVC model, then there will be no need for views here since Jquery will handle everything involving viewing
